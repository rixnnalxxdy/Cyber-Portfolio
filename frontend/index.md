Hey! I'm Rianna - I’m just curious about the cyber world and decided to dive in and learn it.

This site is where I track everything I’m discovering along the way — from basic networking concepts to real hands-on projects. It’s nothing fancy, just a way to keep myself accountable and maybe help someone else who's starting out too.

Here’s my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rianna-libdy/) if you want to connect or a yapper like myself
